# Spree MultiStore Extension
The goal is to be able to host multiple stores with one Spree app. 

# Assumptions:
Individual stores are accessed like this:
<pre>
http://example.com/store1 and http://example.com/store2
</pre>
A partial is added to the users/new form for the store info (views use HAML/SASS)
